## Introduction

This project focuses on the challenge of navigating multiple autonomous robots in dynamic environments while avoiding collisions. The main contributions of this work include:
- A local navigation model that integrates global path planning using attentive graph neural networks.
- The ability to navigate in complex, dynamic environments with noisy sensor data.
- Superior performance when compared to other baselines like NH-OCRA, DLR-NAV, and GA3C-CADRL in multiple simulated environments.
